# ESPHome Component for Grundfos Alpha2 GO Pumps
ESPHome component for reading measurement values from Grundfos Alpha2 Go pumps via bluetooth on esphome devices.

Original code is from [https://github.com/esphome/esphome/tree/dev/esphome/components/alpha3](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/tree/dev/esphome/components/alpha3) <br />
I just adjusted: <br />
geni_request_flow_head <br />
geni_request_power <br />
GENI_RESPONSE_TYPE_FLOW_HEAD <br />
GENI_RESPONSE_TYPE_POWER <br />
to the new(?) values that work with the Alpha2 GO. <br />
I used Android's HCI logging feature + Wireshark to find the values (while using the official Grundfos Go app). <br />

If anyone wants to use this to add official support in esphome feel free to do so. I probably won't get around to it (and figuring out if/how it should maybe be integrated into a more general grundfos Alpha component because maybe these new values are also necessary for new models of the alpha3 pump).

## How to add it as a external component in your home assistant:
1. Access your /config/esphome/ folder (e.g. via the SMB Addon in HassOS)
2. Create a folder named "components"
3. Copy the "alpha2" folder from this repository into it

In your esphome device yaml config add this:

```
external_components:
 - source:
     type: local
     path: components
   components: [alpha2]

esp32_ble_tracker:

ble_client:
  - mac_address: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX # your pump's bluetooth mac here
    id: heatingpump

sensor:
  - platform: alpha2
    ble_client_id: heatingpump
    flow:
      name: "Pump Flow"
    head:
      name: "Pump Pressure"
    speed:
      name: "Pump Speed"
    power:
      name: "Pump Power"
    voltage:
      name: "Pump Voltage"
    current:
      name: "Pump Current"
```

For the first connection I think you need to press the "wifi" button on the pump to put it into pairing mode. <br />
To find out your pump's bluetooth mac use an app like e.g. [nRF Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp) .
